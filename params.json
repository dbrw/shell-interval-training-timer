{"name":"Shell-interval-training-timer","tagline":"shell-interval-workout-timer","body":"Shell interval training timer\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://files.kyle-jensen.com.s3.amazonaws.com/shared/coolidge.jpg\" style=\"float:right\" width=\"490\" height=\"390\">\r\n\r\nA [small shell script](https://github.com/kljensen/shell-interval-training-timer/blob/master/workout.sh) for doing [interval training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training)\r\n(or circuit training) coveniently from your desk.  I was inspired to write this script after\r\nreading the\r\n[NY Times \"Scientific 7-Minute Workout\"](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)\r\narticle\r\ncovering the\r\n[HICT research by Kilka & Jordan](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx).\r\nThe workout from that manuscript is the default for this script.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nThe shell script loops through list of exercises (potentially user-supplied)\r\nand announces each one verbally\r\n(literaly, over your speakers)\r\nusing the [`say` command](http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/SAY/).\r\nThe script sleeps between exercises using the\r\n[`sleep` command](http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/sleep/).  This basically sounds like\r\n\r\n> **Ready? We're going to do 10 exercises for 30s each, starting with  'push ups'.**\r\n\r\n> [a moment passes]\r\n\r\n> **Ok, 'push ups' for 30 seconds, Go!**\r\n\r\n> [30s passes]\r\n\r\n> **Stop, Rest 10 seconds.  Next, you will do 'sit-ups'**\r\n\r\n> [10s passes and the process repeats itself]\r\n\r\nSo, the computer is leading you through the exercises in a manner that\r\n\r\n* keeps track of time for you;\r\n* does not require looking at the computer;\r\n* alerts you to the upcoming exercise so that you can get ready; and,\r\n* allows you to play music in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install the script is to clone the repo on GitHub:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/kljensen/shell-interval-training-timer\r\n\r\nOr you can just grab the shell script\r\n\r\n\tcurl -O https://raw.github.com/kljensen/shell-interval-training-timer/master/workout.sh\r\n\t\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, you probably want to make the script executable\r\n\r\n\tchmod a+x ./workout.sh\r\n\r\nDo the default workout\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh\r\n\r\nOr, you can supply a file with your own exercises, 1 per line\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh -i my-exercises.txt\r\n\r\nFinally, here's how you would supply a file with your own exercises,\r\n1 per line and do each for 45 seconds, resting for 20.\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh -i my-exercises.txt -t 45 -r 20\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\nThis has only been tested on Mac OSX.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
