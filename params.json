I was inspired to write this quick script after\r\nreading the\r\n[NY Times \"Scientific 7-Minute Workout\"](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)\r\narticle\r\ncovering the\r\n[HICT research by Kilka & Jordan](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx).\r\nThe workout from that manuscript is the default for this script.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nThe shell script loops through list of exercises (potentially user-supplied)\r\nand announces each one verbally\r\n(literaly, over your speakers)\r\nusing the [`say` command](http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/SAY/).\r\nThe script sleeps between exercises using the\r\n[`sleep` command](http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/sleep/).  It has only been tested on Mac OSX.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, you probably want to make the script executable\r\n\r\n\tchmod a+x ./workout.sh\r\n\r\nDo the default workout\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh\r\n\r\nOr, you can supply a file with your own exercises, 1 per line\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh -i my-exercises.txt\r\n\r\nFinally, here's how you would supply a file with your own exercises,\r\n1 per line and do each for 45 seconds, resting for 20.\r\n\r\n\t./workout.sh -i my-exercises.txt -t 45 -r 20","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
